<!-- 
    index.html in the static folder will serve as a reponse to the "/" (root) endpoint
    does not need any controller endpoint written for the same.
    This the behaviour of the webserver

    Most web servers take the "index.html" as default page for the root end point
    with some web servers this might change and read the documentation of the appropriate web server

    Such default behaviour can be changed by overriding the root end point in the controller class and returning a different file
